I found myself with some free time over break so I'm trying to modernize some of the Virginia Men's Rowing team's day-to-day operations. 

Instructions to run:

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a virtual environment `python3 -m venv env/`
3. Activate the venv `source env/bin/activate`
4. Create and migrate the database `python3 manage.py migrate`
5. Run the server and open the url in a browser `python3 manage.py runserver`
